## Intuition

The code implements a simple turn-based game where two players (a human and an AI) take turns to add a number (1, 2, or 3) to a shared total, starting from 0. The player who makes the total reach or exceed 20 loses. If the total is exactly 20, it's a draw. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to decide its moves.

## Approach

The approach is to use the Minimax algorithm, which is a recursive algorithm used for decision making in game theory and artificial intelligence. The algorithm computes the optimal move for the AI player assuming that the human player is also playing optimally.

The Minimax algorithm is based on the concept of a zero-sum game, where one player's gain is another player's loss. In this game, the AI player tries to maximize its score (trying to make the human player reach or exceed 20), while the human player tries to minimize the AI's score (trying to make the AI reach or exceed 20).

Alpha-Beta pruning is an optimization technique for the Minimax algorithm. It reduces the number of nodes that need to be evaluated in the game tree by eliminating branches that don't need to be explored.

## Logic

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the logic behind the code:

1. **Minimax Function**: The `minimax` function is a recursive function that takes the current total, whose turn it is (True for AI, False for human), and the current alpha and beta values. It returns the maximum score if it's the AI's turn (maximizing player) and the minimum score if it's the human's turn (minimizing player). The function uses alpha-beta pruning to skip unnecessary branches of the game tree and improve efficiency.

2. **Game Loop**: The game loop gets the human player's move from input, updates the total, and checks if the game is over. If the game is not over, it's the AI's turn. The AI calculates the best move using the `minimax` function and updates the total. The game ends when the total reaches or exceeds 20.

## Example Dry Run

Let's do a dry run of the code with the following sequence of moves:

- Human: 1 (total = 1)
- AI: 3 (total = 4)
- Human: 2 (total = 6)
- AI: 3 (total = 9)
- Human: 1 (total = 10)
- AI: 3 (total = 13)
- Human: 2 (total = 15)
- AI: 3 (total = 18)
- Human: 1 (total = 19)
- AI: 1 (total = 20)

Here's how the code would execute these moves:

```python
# Initial total is 0
total = 0

# Define the minimax function
def minimax(total, is_maximizing, alpha, beta):
    # Base case: If total reaches or exceeds 20, return a high value for winning, low for losing
    if total >= 20:
        return 1 if is_maximizing else -1

    if is_maximizing:
        max_eval = -float('inf')
        for i in range(1, 4):  # AI can add 1, 2, or 3
            eval = minimax(total + i, False, alpha, beta)
            max_eval = max(max_eval, eval)
            alpha = max(alpha, eval)
            if beta <= alpha:
                break
        return max_eval
    else:
        min_eval = float('inf')
        for i in range(1, 4):  # Human can add 1, 2, or 3
            eval = minimax(total + i, True, alpha, beta)
            min_eval = min(min_eval, eval)
            beta = min(beta, eval)
            if beta <= alpha:
                break
        return min_eval

# Game loop
while True:
    # Human's turn
    human_move = int(input("Enter your move (1, 2, or 3): "))
    total += human_move
    print(f"After your move, total is {total}")
    if total >= 20:
        print("You win!")
        break

    # AI's turn
    print("AI is making its move...")
    ai_move = 1
    max_eval = -float('inf')
    for i in range(1, 4):
        eval = minimax(total + i, False, -float('inf'), float('inf'))
        if eval > max_eval:
            max_eval = eval
            ai_move = i
    total += ai_move
    print(f"AI adds {ai_move}. Total is {total}")
    if total >= 20:
        print("AI wins!")
        break

```

In this example, the AI wins because the total reaches 20 after the AI's move. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to decide its moves, always choosing the move that maximizes its score assuming that the human player is also playing optimally.
